To enable the web access start tomcast with -b (listen address) and
-p (listen port parameters).
在启动tomcast的时候可以使用-b（监听地址）和-p(监听端口)参数来启用web access

For example: tomcast -b 127.0.0.1 -p 8081

Now you can access the web interface exposed by tomcast at

    http://127.0.0.1:8081/

The following endpoints are accessible:

    http://127.0.0.1:8081/getconfig

  Return currently configured channels in channels.conf format
  that tomcast uses.


    http://127.0.0.1:8081/reconnect

  Reconnect all sources. If channels have more than one source
  the source will be changed to the next available source.


    http://127.0.0.1:8081/reload

  Reload config file. This would start/stop new/removed channels.


    http://127.0.0.1:8081/status

  Return current channels status. The status looks like this:

# Status   DestAddr             ConnTime  ReadBytes ChanName           ChanSource                                                       ProxyStatus

  "Status" - current channel status which can be CONN_OK or CONN_ERROR

    CONN_ERROR - Means that the source of the channel is currently
                 not connected or bytes read are at least 1316 or
                 ConnTime is 0

  "ProxyStatus" - Last connection status

    Connected
